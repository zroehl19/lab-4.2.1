/*
 * STEP1:
 * Create a generic class called Cuboid that will store the three dimensions of a cuboid. 
 * Add methods to set and get the length, breadth and Height. 
 * Add a method public String toString() that will return all of the dimensions. 
 * The type of the dimensions will be decided at construction of the cuboid instance. 
 * Example:
 *      Cuboid<Double> c1 = new Cuboid<>();
 *      Cuboid<String> c1 = new Cuboid<>();
 *   
 * STEP 2:
 * Modify your generic class Cuboid so that it only accepts Numbers. Add a method with the following definition and complete its body. Hint: Look at the method doubleValue() in the Number class.
 *      public double getVolume(){ ...... }
